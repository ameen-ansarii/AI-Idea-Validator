# AI Idea Validator

## Problem
Many founders waste weeks or months building products without validating whether the idea solves a real problem or has market demand.

## Solution
AI Idea Validator is a decision-support tool that analyzes startup ideas and provides structured, realistic feedback on viability, risks, and next steps.

## What It Does
Users submit an idea as text.  
The system returns a detailed analysis including:
- Target users
- Problem severity score
- Market demand assessment
- Monetization paths
- Risks and blind spots
- MVP recommendation
- Final verdict (build, pivot, or drop)

## Why This Matters
Early validation saves time, money, and effort by identifying weak assumptions before development begins.

## Key Features
- Structured idea analysis
- Honest, non-hyped feedback
- Clear MVP guidance
- Verdict-based decision support

## Use Cases
- Students evaluating hackathon or startup ideas
- Indie founders validating SaaS concepts
- Early-stage teams deciding what to build first

## How It Helps Hackathons
Helps teams avoid weak ideas and focus effort on concepts with real potential.
